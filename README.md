## Features ✨

- Real-time password strength analysis
- Visual strength meter (progress bar)
- Crack time estimation (seconds to years)
- Strength categorization (Weak/Moderate/Strong)
- Toggle password visibility
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Clean, user-friendly interface

## How It Works ⚙️

The tool evaluates passwords based on:
1. **Length** (minimum 8 characters recommended)
2. **Character diversity** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
3. **Entropy calculation** (mathematical strength measurement)

The crack time estimation assumes a brute-force attack at 1 billion guesses per second.

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Clone this repository:
